ðŸ’¡ Turning a Personal Experience into a Purpose-Driven Project

A few months ago, I fell sick and had to wait a long time for a doctor. Sitting there, I realized how difficult it can be to manage appointments, track medications, and get timely treatment. That moment sparked an idea ðŸ’¡â€” why not build something that makes healthcare more accessible?

Thatâ€™s how I started working on my project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This platform is designed to:

âœ… Book Doctor Appointments â€“ Easily schedule and reschedule visits.
âœ… Track Medications & Health â€“ Keep prescriptions and health records in one place.
âœ… Order Medicines Online â€“ Get medicines delivered conveniently.
âœ… Home Visit Requests â€“ Book a doctor for in-home treatment.
âœ… Automated Reminders â€“ Get appointment alerts via WhatsApp and email.

Technology has the power to bridge gaps in healthcare, and Iâ€™m excited to contribute in my own way. ðŸš€
